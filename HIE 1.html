    <p class="my_class" style=" color:black font-weight: 700;font-size: x-large;">Contamination of water bodies such as Seas, Ocean, Lake, Rivers, Ground Water etc is known as water pollution. In other words, physical, chemical and biological changes in the properties of water can be understood as water pollution. It is majorly caused due to ill-activities by humans and has severe consequences on the life of aquatic animals. 
        The water which is spared from human contamination stands fit for drinking as well as various other daily life activities such as cooking, watering plants, washing, etc. Both humans and animals can utilize the fir water but only after purifying it as several other bacterias or pollutants can be present in the water which may not be visible through the naked eye. </p>

<h1 style="color:rgb(73, 73, 243);">WHAT ARE DIFFERENT TYPES OF WATER POLLUTION?:</h1>
<ul style="height: max-content;">
    <li style="font-size:x-large;">Ground water pollution </li>
    <li style="font-size: x-large;">Surface water pollution</li>
    <li style="font-size: x-large;">Sewage water pollution</li>
    <li style="font-size: x-large;">Industrial water polltion</li>
    <li style="font-size: x-large;">Agro chemical water pollution</li>
    <li style="font-size: x-large;">Oil spillages</li>
</ul>
<h1> Ground water pollution :</h1>
<img src="https://t3.ftcdn.net/jpg/01/80/38/96/360_F_180389696_tiUuUTCdoKm1cLB0uHMXyLhbX76ngOoP.jpg" width="650" height="350">
<p style="font-size:x-large;">Groundwater comes from below the Earth’s surface, found in stores called aquifers. A key source of water pollution that ends up in groundwater resources comes from agriculture. Fertilizers and pesticides applied to farmland are easily absorbed into the ground, or they can be transported as runoff during rainfall. </p>
<p style="font-size: x-large;">Groundwater can also become contaminated when waste from landfills and septic systems leaches into the ground. Once these harmful chemicals find their way into groundwater, they are often extracted from wells or boreholes, compromising the quality of water. Therefore, when water is extracted from groundwater resources, it is important that the groundwater must be tested and treated so that it is safe for drinking water supplies and other human uses.
</p>
<h1>Surface water pollution:</h1>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4211/35804022181_77d90015e4_b.jpg" width="650" height="350">
<p style="font-size: x-large;">Surface water refers to all bodies of water above the Earth’s surface, such as oceans, lakes, and rivers. Any hazardous substance that comes into contact with surface water is called surface water pollution.</p>
<p style="font-size: x-large;">Surface water pollution occurs in three ways: naturally, accidentally, and intentionally. </p>
<ul style="font-size: medium;">
    <li>Naturally: Flooding or tsunamis, that pick up fertilizer, pesticides, debris, and other contaminants. </li>
    <li>Accidentally: Oil spills and agricultural runoff. </li>
    <li>Intentionally: Industries dumping waste directly into waterways. </li>
</ul>
<h1>Sewage water polltion:</h1>
<img src="https://www.marineinsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Causes-Of-Sewage-Pollution-In-The-Ocean.jpg" width="650" height="350">
<p style="font-size: x-large;">If sewage is discharged untreated, its nitrogen and phosphorus content can lead to pollution of lakes and reservoirs via a process called eutrophication. In raw sewage, nitrogen exists in the two forms of organic nitrogen or ammonia. The ammonia stems from the urea in urine.Urea is rapidly hydrolyzed and therefore not usually found in raw sewage.Total phosphorus is mostly present in sewage in the form of phosphates.They are either inorganic (polyphosphates and orthophosphates) and their main source is from detergents and other household chemical products. The other form is organic phosphorus, where the source is organic compounds to which the organic phosphorus is bound.</p>
<p style="font-size: x-large;">Sewage is the municipal waste matter that is carried away in sewers and drains. It includes both liquid and solid wastes, rich in organic matter and microbes. Many of these microbes are pathogenic and can cause several water- borne diseases. Sewage water is a major cause of polluting drinking water.</p>
<h1>Industrial water pollution:</h1>
<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/1200x/83/f9/db/83f9dbe9cd2a7af66ea1528095172ecf.jpg" width="650" height="350">
<p style="font-size: x-large;">Industrial discharge contains a large number of hazardous chemicals. It discharges these chemicals directly into the rivers, lakes, or nearby water bodies. These highly toxic chemicals may harm aquatic animals and human beings. Many factories also use freshwater to carry away their waste into the water bodies.Industrial wastewater is the aqueous discard that results from substances having been dissolved or suspended in water, typically during the use of water in an industrial manufacturing process or the cleaning activities that take place along with that process.Industrial wastewater represents the discharges of manufacturing processes, including petrochemical, textile, electroplating, pharmaceutical, and food (Tabassum et al., 2021). Hence, this waste contains a variety of organic and inorganic matter, in addition to toxic and hazardous substances, dyes, and metal ions (Bakr et al., 2021). Moreover, the composition of industrial effluents can include elevated levels of fats, cleaning agents, volatile compounds, and oil that pose risks to human health and the environment.</p>
<p style="font-size: x-large;">It contains toxic chemical,acids,alkalis,mettalic salts,phenols,cyanides,ammonia,radioactive substances,etc.are source of water pollution.</p>
<h1>Agrochemicals:</h1>
<img src="https://jesssb11.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/water-pollution.jpg" width="650" height="350">
<p style="font-size: x-large;">Chemicals are the most common type of water pollution, and many industries use chemicals that can end up in water systems. These chemicals can be anything from metals and solvents in industrial operations, fertilizers and pesticides in the agricultural industry to chemicals used in pest control companies. When the chemicals enter the soil and water systems, it has negative impacts on humans, livestock, and fish that utilize these environments.Agrochemicals like fertilizers(containing nitrates and phosphates) and pesticides(insticides,fungicides,herbicides etc.)washed by rain water and surface run-off pollute water. </p>
<p style="font-size: x-large;">In water settings, chemical water pollution is very toxic to aquatic life, inhibiting their growth, affecting their reproduction, or even causing death. </p>
<h1>Oil spillages:</h1>
<img src="https://t4.ftcdn.net/jpg/05/84/51/73/360_F_584517384_DzQfNXJhSviiouk9AYFToxe7c54PYQ7S.jpg" width="650" height="350">
<p style="font-size: x-large;">An accidental release of oil into a body of water, as from a tanker, offshore drilling rig, or underwater pipeline, often presenting a hazard to marine life and the environment.Oil spills make up 12% of the oil that enters the world’s oceans. The rest of the oil spillages come from shipping/transport, draining, and dumping. Most oil spills are localized, but even a small amount of oil can be extremely hazardous to humans and marine life.Once oil enters the water, it quickly spreads over the surface, reducing the amount of oxygen and sunlight that can penetrate the water’s surface preventing plants to photosynthesize, and suffocating fish. Water pollution from oil spillage also smothers the feathers of seabirds, preventing them from flying and exposes them to oil ingestion when they catch fish. </p>
<h1 style="text-align:left; color: red; "> WHAT ARE THE EFFECTS OF WATER<br>POLLUTION?</br></h1>
<p style="font-size: large;"><b>It is toxic water that cannot be drunk or used for essential purposes like agriculture, and which also causes diseases like diarrhoea, cholera, dysentery, typhoid and poliomyelitis that kill more than 500,000 people worldwide every year.</b></p>
<p style="font-size: large;"><b>Pollution of water affects both humans and aquatic life. Most water sources close to cities and urban centres are polluted by garbage and dumping of chemicals, legally or illegally. Below are some of the common as well as adverse effects of polluting water bodies.</b></p>
<h1>ON HUMANS</h1>

<P style="font-size: x-large;">Pollution of water affects both humans and aquatic life. Most water sources close to cities and urban centres are polluted by garbage and dumping of chemicals, legally or illegally. Below are some of the common as well as adverse effects of polluting water bodies.</P>
<p style="font-size: x-large;">Contaminated water can also make you ill. Every year, unsafe water sickens about 1 billion people. And low-income communities are disproportionately at risk because their homes are often closest to the most polluting industries.</p>
<p style="font-size: x-large;">Even swimming can pose a risk. Every year, 3.5 million Americans contract health issues such as skin rashes, pinkeye, respiratory infections, and hepatitis from sewage-laden coastal waters, according to EPA estimates.</p>
<h1>ON THE ENVIRONMENT</h1>
<img src="https://nunezwatersaversgr14.weebly.com/uploads/1/7/7/5/17753877/721144_orig.jpg" width="650" height="400">
<P style="font-size: x-large;">Water pollution is a major global environmental problem because it can result in the degradation of all aquatic ecosystems fresh, coastal, and ocean waters.The specific contaminants leading to pollution in water include a wide spectrum of chemicals, pathogens, and physical changes such as elevated temperature. While many of the chemicals and substances that are regulated may be naturally occurring (calcium, sodium, iron, manganese, etc.) the concentration usually determines what is a natural component of water and what is a contaminant. High concentrations of naturally occurring substances can have negative impacts on aquatic flora and fauna. Oxygen-depleting substances may be natural materials such as plant matter (e.g. leaves and grass) as well as man-made chemicals. Other natural and anthropogenic substances may cause turbidity (cloudiness) which blocks light and disrupts plant growth, and clogs the gills of some fish species.</P>
<P style="font-size: x-large;">Marine ecosystems are also threatened by marine debris, which can strangle, suffocate, and starve animals. Much of this solid debris, such as plastic bags and soda cans, gets swept into sewers and storm drains and eventually out to sea, turning our oceans into trash soup and sometimes consolidating to form floating garbage patches. Discarded fishing gear and other types of debris are responsible for harming more than 200 different species of marine life.</P>
<h1>CONTROL MEASURES OF WATER POLLUTION:</br></h1>
<p style="font-size: x-large;">1.Minimize the use of pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers. DO NOT dispose of these chemicals, motor oil, or other automotive fluids into the sanitary sewer or storm sewer systems. Both of them end at the river.</p>
<p style="font-size: x-large;">2.Run the dishwasher or clothes washer only when you have a full load. This conserves electricity and water.</p>
<p style="font-size: x-large;">3.Use the minimum amount of detergent and/or bleach when you are washing clothes or dishes. Use only phosphate free soaps and detergents.</p>
<p style="font-size: x-large;">4.Waste Water should be treated by primary and secondary treatment to reduce BOD,COD levels upto permissible levels of discharge.</p>
<p style="font-size: x-large;">5.Non biodegradable Waste materials such as plastics should not be dumped in water bodies.These not only increase the levels of toxins in water but also choke the aquatic organisms to death.</p>
<p style="font-size: x-large;">6.Industrial effluents and wastes must be treated in order to reduce their toxicity</p>
